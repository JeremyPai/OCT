# Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

This repo is a place to store the code which was written while I was in master degree.
It mainly consist of two parts, which are OCT-related codes and DL-related codes.

## OCT Source Code:
+ image reconstruction
+ despeckle process
+ algorithm to get attenuation coeffient of each pixel in the images

## Deep Learning Source Code:
+ create model of ResNet and AttentionResNet
+ data preparation flow
+ create confusion matrix
+ use Grad-CAM to visualize possible features
+ t-SNE to achieve dimension reduction
+ three different training flow, including training with keras, training with tf.GradientTape, and transfer learning

---

We also publish a paper related to this research. 

The main feature is that we are the first one to implement AttentionResNet and accomplish wonderful classification result on brain tumors.
